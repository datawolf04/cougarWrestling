## Weight Classes
The weight classes that our wrestlers compete in are determined by the PCMSAC and are listed below. The minimum allowed weight is 61 lbs. Otherwise, the number listed is the top weight allowed in the weight class. We are not allowed to round weights down.

76, 83, 90, 98, 106, 113, 120, 126, 132, 138, 145, 152, 160, 170, 182, 195, 220, 250

At this age, we do not encourage athletes to actively manage their weight. These are all growing boys. They should eat at healthy diet as they need to in order to properly fuel their bodies as they transition into adulthood.

## Equipment needs

Mouthguards, specifically orthodontic mouthguards, are required if you have braces. This is a safety issue both for your wrestler and his opponent. Additionally, it protects the braces from accidental damage in the wrestling circle. Some orthodontists will give them out to patients for free. Otherwise, they can be purchased from sporting goods stores and other retailers.

We provide head gear and singlets for competition. Wrestlers are strongly encouraged to have wrestling shoes as it allows you to gain traction with the mat. If you do not have shoes, you can wrestle in socks.
