## Weight Classes
The weight classes that our wrestlers compete in are determined by the PCMSAC and are listed below. The minimum allowed weight is 61 lbs. Otherwise, the number listed is the top weight allowed in the weight class. We are not allowed to round weights down.

76, 83, 90, 98, 106, 113, 120, 126, 132, 138, 145, 152, 160, 170, 182, 195, 220, 250

After the Christmas holiday, 2 pounds will be added to each weight class to allow for the natural growth of middle school students over the span of the season. At this age, ***we do not encourage athletes to actively manage their weight.*** These are all growing boys. They should eat at healthy diet as they need to in order to properly fuel their bodies as they transition into adulthood.

## Equipment needs

Mouthguards, specifically double mouth guards, are required if your wrestler has braces. This is a safety issue both for your wrestler and his opponent. Additionally, it protects the braces from accidental damage in the wrestling circle. Some orthodontists will give them out to patients for free. You should consult with your orthodontist to determine which mouth guard is best for your wrestler.

We provide head gear and singlets for competition. Wrestlers are strongly encouraged to have wrestling shoes as it allows you to gain traction with the mat. If you do not have shoes, you can wrestle in socks.
