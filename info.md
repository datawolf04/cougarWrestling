## Weigh ins
Weigh ins will occur once per week on Mondays. There will be a coach there by 5:45 to start weighing in, so if you can get there a bit early, that will help get everyone ready.

## Wrestle offs
We will do wrestle offs once every two weeks. Each wrestler will be grouped by weight class and wrestle within his class OR the class that is one level higher than his natural weight class. The top two wrestlers in each weight class will form the travel squad. 

## Challenges
We allow wrestlers to challenge the travel squad members at most once per week. Please notify Coach Howard at least one day in advance so that we can work that into practice time.

## Getting better at home
Practice time is short, as is the season. You will improve only as much as you work. We focus on technique when we are in practice, but technique gets sloppy when you are tired. So we encourage you to spend some time every day working on your conditioning. Even 15 minutes of hard work and sweat can be beneficial.

### At home conditioning workout ideas
Wrestling is a sport that requires sustained bursts of effort, and conditioning is important. We encourage you to spend some time working out every day, improving strength and stamina. Each round of a wrestling match is 2 minutes, and there are 3 rounds with very little break between them. Some ideas to get you started:

- Body weight exercises such as push-ups, sit-ups, mountain climbers, and burpees. It would be a good idea to do these in a circuit. For example do 30 seconds of each exercise, then take a 1 minute break. Work up to 5 sets.
- Aerobic exercise such as jogging, cycling, or jumping rope. Make sure you vary your speed and effort so that you are working up a sweat.
- High Intensity Interval Training (HIITs) are good ideas too. You can find videos on YouTube or other places with things to guide you.

## Additional opportunities to wrestle
*Placeholder for now. I know one of the coaches has info about the Greenville Titans. You have mentioned tournaments. It would be good to have a place to learn more.*
