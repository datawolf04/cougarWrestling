Hello Cougar wrestlers and parents. This page is designed to enhance communication between the coaches and you. We are so excited to have so many of your boys wrestling with us and are thankful for the opportunity to help mold these young men. Our goal is to help everyone who is interested in wrestling to learn how to wrestle and improve every day.

Practice are held in the DH Conley HS wrestling room every Monday-Thursday 6pm-7:30pm, unless we have a meet that day.  Also, if Pitt County Schools are not in session, there is no practice. If you cannot be at practice, please email [Coach Howard](garyjhoward04@gmail.com) or call/text him at (###)###-####.

## Meets
All meets begin at 4pm.  Home meets are at GR Whitfield.

## Weight Classes
The weight classes that our wrestlers compete in are determined by the PCMSAC and are listed below. The minimum allowed weight is 61 lbs. Otherwise, the number listed is the top weight allowed in the weight class. We are not allowed to round weights down.

76, 83, 90, 98, 106, 113, 120, 126, 132, 138, 145, 152, 160, 170, 182, 195, 220, 250

At this age, we do not encourage athletes to actively manage their weight. These are all growing boys. They should eat at healthy diet as they need to in order to properly fuel their bodies as they transition into adulthood.

## Additional opportunities to wrestle
*Placeholder for now. I know one of the coaches has info about the Greenville Titans. You have mentioned tournaments. It would be good to have a place to learn more.*
