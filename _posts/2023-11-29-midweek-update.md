We have had a strong week on the mat so far. 

## Monday - Wrestle-offs
On Monday, we had our first wrestle offs of the season to determine who competes at the meet this week. Congratulations to all of the boys who won their weight classes.

## Tuesday - Meet vs. Greene County MS
We traveled to came up a little short (57-46), but we gained some valuable experience! Pictures from the match were shared on the ClassDojo page. Some notable performers:

- Name 1 won the xxx weight class by pin.
- Name 2 won the xxx weight class by technical fall.

## Wednesday - Meet vs. North Pitt MS

We are welcoming North Pitt MS to the gym at GR Whitfield. Tickets for the match can be purchased [on GoFan](https://gofan.co/app/school/NC25589). Wrestlers on the practice team are encouraged to attend for free.
