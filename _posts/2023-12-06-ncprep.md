## Meet vs. NC Prep MS
I was very excited to see that all of the wrestlers are travelers now. We've had an eventful 2 weeks of wrestling where we are currently 2-2. I'm sure the other coaches would agree that we could be 4-0 right now, but hey, it's a work in progress. Our winners from last night are as follows:

- Easton Meadows
- Bryce Lewis
- Ayden Curtis
- Hayden Lovett
- Ben Byma
- Jackson Wainwright
- Mike King
- Rafaan Ahmad
- Lecine Devine
- John Calwell
- Travarus Gunter

We also had exhibition winners last night who were:
- Grady Conway
- Hudson Brown
- Alexander Lopez-Gonzales

Hall of fame Coach Milt Sherman will be at practice 12/7 to go over mistakes made during the AG Cox match and the other coaches will help prepare our grapplers for next week's tri-match against North Pitt and PS Jones (December 12th @ North Pitt).

Always forward.
