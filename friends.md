## Coach Milt Sherman
Milt Sherman is the long-time coach at DH Conley, where he coached his teams to both individual success [43 All-State wrestlers (including Coach Howard) as well as multiple State Champions and All-Americans] and team success [multiple conference championships, multiple regional championships, multiple state runner-up, and a state championship]. This distinguished coaching career earned him entry into the [NCHSAA Hall of Fame](https://www.nchsaa.org/nchsaa-announces-eight-join-hall-fame-class-2020/) in 2020. Now that he has retired, he's volunteering his time to come out to our meets to watch our wrestlers and help them improve their technique.
